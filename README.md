The following is the basics of a Large Language Model(LMM) where a Neural Networks(NN) that is trained by using the NMIST data set revolving handwritten numbers and ends up predicting handwritten letters. The model only uses np and avoides the usage of larger libraries so all of the math behind the seen is clearly shown.

Purpose: It was used for me to have a deeper understand on how NNs work and develop a better fundamental base when it comes to training a simple model, the steps involved and different techniques to get the best result.
