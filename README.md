# character-recognition-NN
The following is the basics of a Large Language Model(LMM) where a Neural Networks(NN) that is trained using the NMIST data set. The data set includes handwritten numbers and the model does use NN to train, predict, and test against trying to predict these values. The model only uses np and avoides the usage of larger libraries so all of the math behind the seen is clearly shown.

Purpose: It was used for me to have a deeper understand on how NNs work and develop a better fundamental base when it comes to training a simple model, how hidden layers work mathmatically, the steps involved in the process of development, and different techniques to get the best result.
